## üöÄ Running Locally

1. Set up PostgreSQL and create a DB with name "clinic"
        
        1.1 create DB with name "clinic_test" (Dummy db for testing)

2. Clone this repo
3. Create a `.env` file at root:

   ```.env
    DB_HOST= localhost
    DB_PORT= 5432
    DB_USER= postgres
    DB_PASSWORD= YourPassowrd123
    DB_NAME= clinic

   ```
   Also create a `.env` file in tests folder:

   ```.env
    DB_HOST= localhost
    DB_PORT= 5432
    DB_USER= postgres
    DB_PASSWORD= YourPassowrd123
    DB_NAME= clinic_test

   ```
4. Run the server from root:
    ```cmd
        go run cmd/main.go
    ```

5. Postman for testing Api, and doing CRUD operations based on roles:
  ```.env
   1. Open Postman App or Web.
   2. In the sidebar:
     Click "Collections".
   3. Click the "Import" button (top-left).
   4. In the popup:
        Choose "Upload Files".
        Select your .json file (e.g., clinic-api.postman_collection.json).
        Click "Import".
             
```
 - After you import this into Postman, after Auth phase, use generated login token for role based( Doctor/Receptionist) operations. we made 2 users -> doctor01, reception1 
 - Refer this Postman doc of this project for further clarity: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/43825571/2sB2x5GsE7
 - After this, now you can Create/read/update/delete based on your role.
 - For testing unit test stub
  ```
    go test ./tests/... -v
  ```
6. Check your database for patients and regestered users:
   ```
   1. Right-click on "clinic" database
   2. Select "Query Tool"
   3. To see list of patients run:
       select * from public.patients;
   4. To see list of users run:
       select * from public.users;
    ```
